## [1.0.0] - 2025-10-06

### ðŸŽ‰ Initial Production Release

I'm excited to announce the first stable release of LogGem! This release includes everything you need for AI-powered log anomaly detection in production environments.

### Added

#### Core Features
- **AI-Powered Anomaly Detection** with context-aware analysis
- **Multi-Provider LLM Support**: HuggingFace (local), OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama
- **12 Built-in Log Parsers**: Syslog, Auth, Nginx, Apache, JSON, Windows Event, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Docker, Kubernetes, HAProxy, Redis
- **Adjustable Sensitivity**: Fine-tune detection thresholds (0.0-1.0)
- **Privacy-First Design**: Run completely offline with local models

#### Enterprise Features
- **Real-Time Streaming**: Monitor log files as they grow with tail-style streaming
- **Advanced Alerting System**: Multi-channel alerts (Email, Slack, Webhook, PagerDuty, Console)
- **Batch Processing**: High-throughput log analysis with parallel processing
- **Intelligent Caching**: LRU caching for duplicate entry detection
- **Report Generation**: Export to JSON, CSV, HTML formats
- **Audit Logging**: Complete audit trail for all operations

#### Parsers
- **Syslog Parser**: RFC 3164 and RFC 5424 support
- **Auth Log Parser**: Linux authentication logs (SSH, sudo, su)
- **Nginx Parser**: Access and error log parsing
- **Apache Parser**: httpd access and error logs
- **JSON Parser**: Structured JSON log parsing
- **Windows Event Parser**: Security, System, Application logs
- **PostgreSQL Parser**: Database log parsing
- **MySQL Parser**: MySQL/MariaDB log parsing
- **Docker Parser**: Container log parsing (JSON, compose, CLI formats)
- **Kubernetes Parser**: Pod logs, events, container runtime
- **HAProxy Parser**: Load balancer HTTP/TCP logs
- **Redis Parser**: Redis database logs with command parsing

#### LLM Providers
- **HuggingFace Provider**: Local model support (Gemma 3, Llama, Mistral, Qwen)
- **OpenAI Provider**: GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4-turbo integration
- **Anthropic Provider**: Claude 3 Haiku, Sonnet, Opus support
- **Ollama Provider**: Local Ollama API integration

#### Configuration
- **Pydantic-based Settings**: Type-safe configuration with validation
- **YAML Configuration**: Human-friendly config files
- **Environment Variables**: Override settings via env vars
- **Multiple Config Sources**: File, env vars, and programmatic configuration

#### CLI Interface
- **Analyze Command**: Analyze log files with AI detection
- **Watch Command**: Real-time log monitoring
- **Info Command**: System and configuration information
- **Rich Terminal Output**: Colorized output with progress bars
- **JSON Export**: Export results for further processing

#### Performance Optimizations
- **Streaming Parsers**: Memory-efficient parsing for large files
- **Model Quantization**: INT8 quantization for reduced memory usage
- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple entries efficiently
- **Smart Caching**: Cache analysis results to avoid duplicate work
- **Async Support**: Non-blocking I/O for streaming operations

#### Testing & Quality
- **142 Passing Tests**: Comprehensive test coverage
- **56% Code Coverage**: 90%+ coverage on core modules
- **Multi-OS Testing**: Ubuntu, macOS, Windows support
- **Multi-Python Testing**: Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12 support
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing with GitHub Actions
- **Security Scanning**: Bandit and safety integration
- **Code Quality**: Ruff linting, Black formatting, mypy type checking

#### Documentation
- **Comprehensive README**: Complete project documentation
- **Architecture Guide**: System design and patterns
- **Testing Guide**: Coverage reports and best practices
- **Deployment Guide**: Production deployment instructions
- **Examples Guide**: Usage examples and tutorials
- **Security Policy**: Vulnerability reporting and best practices
- **Contributing Guide**: How to contribute to the project
- **API Documentation**: Python API reference

### Technical Details

#### Python Support
- Minimum Python version: 3.9
- Tested on Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12
- Type hints throughout codebase
- PEP 484 compliant

#### Dependencies
- Minimal required dependencies (7 core packages)
- Optional dependencies for each LLM provider
- Development dependencies separate from runtime
- Security-focused dependency management

#### Security
- Input validation and sanitization
- No remote code execution
- Audit logging for all operations
- Secure defaults throughout
- Privacy-first design with local models

### Known Limitations

- CLI testing at 0% (functional but untested)
- Some parsers have lower coverage (16-32%)
- Large files (>1GB) benefit from streaming mode
- Detection accuracy depends on LLM quality

### Migration Notes

This is the initial release, so no migration is required.
