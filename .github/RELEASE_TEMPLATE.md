I'm thrilled to announce the first stable release of LogGem! This release marks LogGem as production-ready with comprehensive testing, documentation, and enterprise features.

## üåü Highlights

- **AI-Powered Detection**: Multiple LLM providers (HuggingFace, OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama)
- **12 Built-in Parsers**: Support for major log formats out of the box
- **Enterprise Features**: Real-time streaming, multi-channel alerting, batch processing
- **Production Ready**: 142 passing tests, 56% code coverage, multi-OS support
- **Privacy First**: Run completely offline with local models

## üì¶ Installation

### Quick Install

```bash
pip install loggem
```

### With LLM Provider

```bash
# Local models (recommended for privacy)
pip install loggem[huggingface]

# OpenAI
pip install loggem[openai]

# Anthropic
pip install loggem[anthropic]

# All providers
pip install loggem[all]
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# Analyze a log file
loggem analyze /var/log/auth.log

# Real-time monitoring
loggem watch /var/log/syslog

# With custom output
loggem analyze /var/log/nginx/access.log --output report.json
```

## üéØ Use Cases

- **Brute Force Detection**: Identify repeated failed login attempts
- **Insider Threat Detection**: Spot unusual access patterns
- **Web Application Security**: Detect SQL injection, XSS attacks
- **Misconfiguration Detection**: Find security vulnerabilities
- **Compliance Monitoring**: Track access for HIPAA, PCI-DSS, SOC 2
- **Real-Time Security Monitoring**: Live monitoring with instant alerts

## üîí Security

LogGem is designed with security in mind:

- Input validation and sanitization
- No remote code execution
- Secure defaults throughout
- Complete audit logging
- Privacy-first with local models
- Minimal dependencies

See [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/cbritt0n/loggem/blob/main/SECURITY.md) for our security policy.

## üìä Performance

On modest hardware (8GB RAM, no GPU):

- **Processing Speed**: ~1,000 log entries/second (batch mode)
- **Memory Usage**: ~4GB with Gemma 3 4B (INT8 quantization)
- **Model Load Time**: ~10 seconds (first run, cached thereafter)
- **Detection Latency**: <100ms per entry (with caching)

## üêõ Known Issues

- CLI testing at 0% coverage (functional but needs tests)
- Some parsers have lower coverage (16-32%)
- Large files (>1GB) benefit from streaming mode
- Detection accuracy depends on LLM quality

See [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/cbritt0n/loggem/issues) for the complete list.
